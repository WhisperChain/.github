# Whisper Chain
## About the app
<p>Experience the thrill of chain mutations with our game, originally developed as part of the ETHIndia Hackathon :computer: 
We've transformed it into a fun social experiment! Introducing Whisper Chain, our take on the classic game of Chinese whispers or telephone:telephone_receiver:
</p>

<p>Built on <a href="https://www.lens.xyz">Lens Protocol</a>, the objective of the game is simple: there's no winning or losing. Instead, the goal is to observe how much the original seed image changes as it gets passed along the chain. Check how mutations translate into a completely new image over a single chain! ðŸ‘€

## Get Involved!
The concept is super simple:
- :herb: Sign in with your Lens profile.
- ðŸ‘‰Â Check out how the community has generated their mutations and generate to add your own to the chain.
- :sunrise_over_mountains: Recreate the last whisper added to the chain by describing the image as best as you can, in as many words + using our fire filters.
- :moneybag: Collect the NFTs to show your support; the collect proceeds go to the user who generated it.
